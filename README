This plugin is a simplified version of one found here: https://github.com/mcfunley/sbt-mongodb-plugin.That one was developed for a pre-0.10.1 version of SBT and I needed something more current.Unlike mcfunley's version, this one does not start/stop mongo but rather assumes you have an instancerunning already someplace.Fixtures go in /src/test/resources/fixtures by default.  File naming convention determines database andcollection used to load data.<db_name>.<collection_name>.jsonJavascript migration scripts can also be placed in this directory.  They will run immediately after the data is loaded, and have the following file naming convention:<db_name>.migration.jsEnjoy!
